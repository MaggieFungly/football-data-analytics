Clustering methods are utilized to identify players' styles of play and performance metrics. This analysis focuses on the top three actions most frequently performed by a player, which include:

- Types of actions
- Locations of these actions
- End locations of the actions
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for each action

For each of these features, means and standard deviations are calculated. Furthermore, Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to cluster players based on these metrics, while ISOMAP is used to visualize the clustering results.

With EM clustering, players can be roughly divided into three clusters, as indicated below.
